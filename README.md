# The_Three_Cs

This app uses React-Passport to secure users data and create a personalized database for recording transactions. After registering and logging into the Calculating Commercial Calendar users are then given a calander with the username and calculated budget shown. The users may then add additional events such as "payday: +400, Groceries: -200", which will then be calculated and returned to the user.

The next step in development for this application will be having the transactions display on the correct date when the calendar is loaded.
